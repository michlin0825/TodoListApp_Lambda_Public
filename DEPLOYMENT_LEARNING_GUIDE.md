## üö® **Critical Infrastructure Patterns**

### **1. Asset Management & Bundling**

#### **Common Issues:**
- CDK asset bundling inconsistency between local and CI/CD environments
- Lambda source code paths incorrectly resolved from CDK project location
- Build artifacts losing proper directory structure across pipeline stages
- Inconsistent Lambda deployment between local development and CI/CD

#### **Watch For:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Ensure CDK asset bundling is consistent between local and CI/CD environments
‚úÖ Verify Lambda source code paths are correctly resolved from CDK project location
‚úÖ Test both `Code.FromAsset()` with bundling and direct zip deployment methods
‚úÖ Validate that build artifacts maintain proper directory structure across pipeline stages
‚úÖ Confirm Docker availability for CDK asset bundling in CodeBuild environment
```

#### **Prompt Extension:**
```markdown
**Asset Bundling Requirements:**
- Include comprehensive asset bundling validation
- Ensure Lambda deployment consistency between local development and CI/CD pipeline environments
- Test both CDK asset bundling and direct zip deployment approaches
- Validate Docker availability in CodeBuild for .NET compilation
- Include verification commands in buildspec to confirm asset structure
```

#### **Implementation Example:**
```csharp
// Robust asset bundling with validation
Code = Code.FromAsset("../Backend", new AssetOptions
{
    Bundling = new BundlingOptions
    {
        Image = Runtime.DOTNET_8.BundlingImage,
        Command = new[]
        {
            "/bin/sh", "-c",
            "dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools --version 5.10.5 && " +
            "dotnet lambda package --output-package /asset-output/function.zip && " +
            "echo 'Asset bundling completed successfully' && " +
            "ls -la /asset-output/"  // Validation step
        }
    }
})
```

### **2. S3 Frontend Deployment Automation (CRITICAL)**

#### **Common Issues:**
- CDK showing "SUCCESS" but frontend files not actually deployed to S3
- Missing BucketDeployment construct in CDK stack
- S3 bucket policies blocking public website access
- Frontend files excluded by .gitignore or CDK bundling rules

#### **Watch For:**
```markdown
üî¥ CRITICAL: CDK deployment success ‚â† frontend files uploaded
‚úÖ Ensure BucketDeployment construct is included in CDK stack
‚úÖ Verify public read access is properly configured
‚úÖ Confirm frontend files are not excluded by bundling rules
‚úÖ Test website accessibility after deployment
‚úÖ Validate S3 bucket website configuration is active
```

#### **Prompt Extension:**
```markdown
**Frontend Deployment Requirements:**
- CRITICAL: Ensure S3 frontend deployment is automated within CDK stack using BucketDeployment construct
- Verify public read access is properly configured and frontend files are actually uploaded during deployment
- Include post-deployment verification that website is accessible
- Test all frontend pages (index.html, create.html, edit.html) are properly deployed
- Validate S3 bucket website hosting configuration is active
```

#### **Implementation Example:**
```csharp
// Essential BucketDeployment construct - DO NOT OMIT
new BucketDeployment(this, "DeployWebsite", new BucketDeploymentProps
{
    Sources = new[] { Source.Asset("../Frontend") },
    DestinationBucket = websiteBucket,
    Exclude = new[] { "server.py", ".DS_Store" },
    // Validation: Ensure deployment actually occurs
    RetainOnDelete = false
});
```

```

#### **Implementation Example:**
```yaml
# Robust buildspec artifact configuration
artifacts:
  files:
    - "**/*"  # Capture everything
  name: "BuildArtifacts"
  base-directory: "."
post_build:
  commands:
    - echo "Verifying artifact structure:"
    - find . -name "Backend" -type d
    - ls -la Backend/ || echo "Backend directory not found"
